# Overview

As a software engineer I'm focused on using the best tech stack for the desired outcome. Which means it's important to be proficient in a variety of programming languages. 

This program is a basic to-do list, the user can add or delete items from their list. The data is recorded in a .txt file. 


# Development Environment

Visual Studio Code
Python
tkinter


# Useful Websites

* [python.org](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html)
* [tkinter.ttk](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.ttk.html#using-ttk)


# Future Work

* Program UI is very clunky, needs to be improved, would probably use different UI tech in future builds
* Add functionality to allow user to check or cross off item when completed
* Work out glitches- items are being duplicated in backend list when deleted.
